        C-Ratio needs to be at least 300%.<br />
        If your C-Ratio is above 500%, youâ€™ll earn rewards in wFTM.<br />
        If your C-Ratio falls below 300%, your wFTM will be locked (not liquidated) until the C-Ratio goes back to at
        least 300%. That can happen either via FTM price fluctuations or if you add more wFTM as collateral.
